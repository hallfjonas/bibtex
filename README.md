# bibtex
My personal bibliography file. When writing a paper use this as a submodule. Update changes!
This file should be compatible with JabRef.

## Linked files
The files are currently linked under /home/jonas/PhD/readings ...
I moved all papers to google drive (hallj@bu.edu) and mounted that to ~/google-drive
Then I created a link from /home/jonas/PhD/readings to ~/google-drive/readings
